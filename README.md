Files and code for original manuscript on fatigue robustness

1. "Raw Data" - folder containing raw data files from contractile experiments
2. "Metadata.csv" - csv file containing data unique to each recording needed for analysis
3. "Analyze ISO Fatigue V3.r" - code to analyze an individual isotonic type contraction; also creates plots of single contraction data. Requires edits for metadata matching the individual trials being analyzed.
